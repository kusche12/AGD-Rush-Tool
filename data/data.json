I am so glad to see that you're back today for preference round. You were such a light to talk to and demonstrated a great sense of optimism. I also appreciated how you weren't afraid to share your values and your belief in Christianity to someone you had just met. That takes a lot of courage and I deeply respect you for that, as it has been something I have struggled with over the years. I think that you would be a great fit for our chapter but ultimately the decision is in your hands, so follow your heart! I hope you enjoy talking to Emily as she is a great friend of mine and I am wishing you the best with your decision! \r\n\r\nMuch love,\r\n\r\nKarissa Stevens"
